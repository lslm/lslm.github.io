Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I knowâ€¦ You donâ€™t know me. That why I would like to introduce myself.

Iâ€™m Lucas and I work as Software Engineer at [Nubank][nubank-link], the world's largest fintech outside Asia.
I previously worked at Plataformatec until it was [acqui-hired by Nubank][plataformatec-aquisition] and thatâ€™s why I have
experience with Ruby and Elixir projects.

In this blog, I will share things about programming (mostly about Clojure, Elixir and Ruby), career
and Software Engineering in general. I donâ€™t promise that I will update this blog frequently.
But you can always be sure that I will share things that I find interesting and helpful to the community. ðŸ™‚

You can also find in my [GitHub][github-url] and [LinkedIn][linkedin-url].

Well... I hope you enjoy this blog. Thanks!
